Temp converter is a project that I have completed in JavaScript. It is a simple conversion tool that allows users to convert temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa. The code is well written and easy to use, and the user interface is clean and user-friendly. I am proud of this project, and I believe that it will be helpful for many people.
